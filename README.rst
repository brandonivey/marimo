Welcome to marimo's documentation!
==================================
marimo is a framework for creating asynchronously loading widgets.

A marimo installation consists of three parts.
#) A page that contains marimo widgets
#) Javasctipt that manages and loads widgets in the page
#) A backend api that provides widgets with the templates and context for them to use in rendering
